 DETECTING A TWITTER CYBERBULLYING USING MACHINE LEARNING
 In recent years, social media has garnered significant attention among children and adolescents, making these age groups particularly vulnerable to the risks of cyberbullying. The rapid dissemination of cyberbullying posts can result inlong-lasting emotional and psychological harm, often persisting online for extended periods, sometimes indefinitely. The impact of cyberbullying can be severe, leadingto mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and, in extreme cases, suicide. This study aims to identify instances of cyberbullying in Turkish Twitter posts,filling a crucial gap in the literature. The model was trained using both social media features and textual features extracted from the dataset, creating a comprehensive framework for detection.To extract textual features, we utilized various methods, including Bag of Words (BOW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF), Hashing Vectorizer, N-grams, and word embeddings. Each of thesemethods captures different aspects of the language used in tweets, enhancing themodel’s ability to identify nuances associated with cyberbullying. The experiments indicated that features derived from TF-IDF and unigrams significantly improved the model’s performance, highlighting the importance of term frequency in understanding the context of tweets. Furthermore, we conducted comparative analyses with well-established deep learning models in the literature, such as LongShort-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).The widespread use of social media platforms such asTwitter has led to an increase in online harassment, particularly cyberbullying. This phenomenon has significant psychological, emotional, and social impacts onvictims, necessitating the development of effective detection mechanisms. The results demonstrate that machine learning can be a viable solution for detecting cyberbullying on Twitter, with the model achieving competitive performance. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to create safer online environmentsthrough automated cyberbullying detection systems.
